// This module exports a function that takes an application object (app) as its argument.
module.exports = app => {
  // The function is expected to insert the auth middleware into the application.
  // However, the implementation of this functionality is missing.
};

// Ideally, you would require the necessary middleware and use it to protect certain routes or functionalities.
// Here's an example of how you might implement this:

const authMiddleware = require('./auth-middleware');

module.exports = app => {
  app.use('/api/private', authMiddleware());
};

// This way, any request to the '/api/private' route will have to pass through the authMiddleware first.
